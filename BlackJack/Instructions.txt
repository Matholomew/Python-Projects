Exercise - Testing Blackjack Strategies
Objective: Simulate two approaches to playing Blackjack and show which produces better results in the long run for the player.

Extend your previous Blackjack program so that the Player object plays according to a strategy (e.g. always draw another card if your current score is 17).
Implement two different strategies and run them enough times to gather decent statistics on which strategy is more effective.  You may choose the two strategies you employ.

Design hint: the Player does some things the same no matter which way the game is being played.
But the player does some things differently (has a very different implementation) when their strategy changes.
This makes the Strategy pattern a potentially good choice for creating an architecture that avoids code repetition, and avoids inelegant if-then-else statements.
We would prefer not to see "do this if playerstrategy == strategy1 else do that" statements.
